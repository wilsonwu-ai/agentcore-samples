Welcome to the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Samples repository!

Amazon Bedrock AgentCore is both framework-agnostic and model-agnostic, giving you the flexibility to deploy and operate advanced AI agents securely and at scale. Whether you’re building with [Strands Agents](https://strandsagents.com/latest/), [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/), [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph), [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), or any other framework—and running them on any Large Language Model (LLM)—Amazon Bedrock AgentCore provides the infrastructure to support them. By eliminating the undifferentiated heavy lifting of building and managing specialized agent infrastructure, Amazon Bedrock AgentCore lets you bring your preferred framework and model, and deploy without rewriting code.

This collection provides examples and tutorials to help you understand, implement, and integrate Amazon Bedrock AgentCore capabilities into your applications.

> **Migrating from the Starter Toolkit?** This repository is transitioning from the [Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit) to the new [AgentCore CLI](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli). Samples that still depend on the Starter Toolkit are in [`legacy/`](./legacy/) and will be updated over the coming weeks. See [`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md) for the full old-path to new-path mapping.

## 🎥 Video

Build your first production-ready AI agent with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. We’ll take you beyond prototyping and show you how to productionize your first agentic AI application using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.

**Starter Toolkit Samples (Pending Migration)**

Samples that still depend on the [Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/bedrock-agentcore-starter-toolkit) CLI. These will be migrated to the AgentCore CLI as SDK support rolls out. See [`MIGRATION.md`](./MIGRATION.md) for status.

## Quick Start with the AgentCore CLI

The [AgentCore CLI](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli) is the recommended way to create, develop, and deploy agents on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. It replaces the previous Starter Toolkit with a streamlined project-based workflow.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

- An [AWS account](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin?redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fportal.aws.amazon.com%2Fbilling%2Fsignup%2Fresume&client_id=signup) with credentials configured (`aws configure`)
- [Node.js 20.x](https://nodejs.org/) or later
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (for Python agents) or Node.js (for TypeScript agents)
- Model Access: Anthropic Claude 4.0 enabled in [Amazon Bedrock console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html)
- AWS Permissions:
  - `BedrockAgentCoreFullAccess` managed policy
  - `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` managed policy

### Step 2: Install the CLI and Create a Project

```bash
# Install the AgentCore CLI
npm install -g @aws/agentcore

# Create a new project (interactive wizard)
agentcore create
cd my-agent
```

The `create` wizard scaffolds a ready-to-run project with your choice of framework (Strands Agents, LangGraph, Google ADK, OpenAI, and more) and language (Python or TypeScript).

### Step 3: Develop Locally

```bash
# Start the local development server
agentcore dev
```

Your agent is now running locally. The CLI watches for file changes and provides a local invocation endpoint for testing.

### Step 4: Deploy to AWS

```bash
# Deploy to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
agentcore deploy

# Test your deployed agent
agentcore invoke
```

### Add More Capabilities

```bash
agentcore add memory           # Add managed memory
agentcore add identity         # Add identity provider
agentcore add evaluator        # Add LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation
agentcore add online-eval      # Enable continuous evaluation
agentcore deploy               # Sync changes to AWS
```

Congratulations! Your agent is now running on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime.

For the full CLI reference, see the [AgentCore CLI documentation](https://github.com/aws/agentcore-cli).

## Running a Notebook

Some samples in this repository are provided as Jupyter notebooks:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Export/Activate required AWS Credentials for the notebook to run

4. Register your virtual environment as a kernel for Jupyter notebook to use

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=notebook-venv --display-name="Python (notebook-venv)"
```

You can list your kernels using:

```bash
jupyter kernelspec list
```

5. Run the notebook and ensure the correct kernel is selected

```bash
jupyter notebook path/to/your/notebook.ipynb
```

**Important:** After opening the notebook in Jupyter, make sure to select the correct kernel by going to `Kernel` → `Change kernel` → select "Python (notebook-venv)" to ensure your virtual environment packages are available.
