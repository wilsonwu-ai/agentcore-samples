# Automation Agents

Agents that run without a user in the loop. They are triggered by system events such as file uploads, queue messages, scheduled jobs, or webhooks, and they process work end-to-end until they either complete or hit a confidence threshold that requires human review.

## Service configuration

| Service | Typical setup for automation agents |
|---------|-------------------------------------|
| Identity | Service credentials; the agent authenticates as itself |
| Memory | Minimal or none; persistent state lives in the event payload or an external database |
| Runtime | Longer timeouts, no streaming required |
| Guardrails | Confidence thresholds to decide when to auto-complete vs. escalate to a human |
| Observability | Throughput and accuracy metrics rather than per-user traces |
| Gateway | System-to-system API access: ticketing systems, ERPs, payment processors |

## Common patterns

| Pattern | When it fits |
|---------|-------------|
| Workflow (DAG) | A sequence of dependent steps, e.g. validate invoice, match PO, generate payment file |
| Agents-as-tools | An orchestrator delegates to specialized sub-agents for distinct tasks |
| A2A | Agents on separate runtimes that communicate using the A2A protocol |
| Human-in-the-loop | The agent completes what it can and flags items below a confidence threshold for human review |
