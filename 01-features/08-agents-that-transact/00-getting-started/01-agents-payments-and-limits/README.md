## Overview

The shared payment stack — payment manager, connector, IAM roles, and a funded wallet (instrument) —
is already provisioned from [Tutorial 00](../00-setup-agentcore-payments/). Here your agent code
uses the AgentCore SDK to open a **spending session** (a per-request budget you set per user) and pay
each HTTP 402 automatically. You run two agents that both call x402-protected endpoints under a
`maxSpendAmount` budget:

- **Strands** — `AgentCorePaymentsPlugin` intercepts 402 responses from the `http_request` tool and
  pays automatically. Zero payment logic in the agent code.
- **LangGraph** — a `wrap_with_auto_402()` wrapper detects a 402, calls
  `PaymentManager.generate_payment_header()`, and retries with the proof header. The LLM never sees
  the 402.

Both scripts read the same `PaymentManager` ARN and instrument from `.env`, and work with either
wallet provider (Coinbase CDP or Stripe/Privy) and either network (Ethereum Base Sepolia or Solana
Devnet) — the only thing that changes is the instrument ID from Tutorial 00.

> **Billable resources.** Each successful x402 call spends testnet USDC from your funded wallet and
> is metered by AgentCore payments. See [AgentCore pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agentcore/pricing/).

> **Testnet only.** Use Base Sepolia (network `ETHEREUM`) or Solana Devnet (network `SOLANA`) with
> free USDC from [faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com/). Testnet USDC has no monetary value.

> **Supported regions:** `us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-southeast-2`.

## Architecture

### Strands

![Strands Payment Flow](images/strands_payment_flow.png)

```
Agent (Strands + http_request tool)
  │
  ├─► http_request GET https://x402-test.genesisblock.ai/api/weather
  │                         │
  │                   Server returns HTTP 402 (x402 payment required)
  │                         │
  │         AgentCorePaymentsPlugin intercepts 402
  │                         │
  │         ProcessPayment ─► budget check ─► sign tx ─► return proof
  │                         │
  │         Plugin retries http_request with X-PAYMENT header
  │                         │
  ├─► 200 OK ─ agent receives paid content
  │
  └─► Agent summarizes results for the user
```

### LangGraph

![LangGraph Payment Flow](images/langgraph_payment_flow.png)

```
LangGraph ReAct Agent
  └── wrapped http_request tool
        ├── Makes HTTP request
        ├── Gets 402? → PaymentManager.generate_payment_header()
        ├── Retries with proof header
        └── Returns content to agent (LLM never sees the 402)
```

## Prerequisites

- **Tutorial 00 completed** — the shared `.env` (one directory up, at
  [`00-getting-started/.env`](../)) must contain `PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN`, `USER_ID`, and
  `INSTRUMENT_ID` (`NETWORK` is optional and defaults to `ETHEREUM`). The scripts read these via
  `utils.load_tutorial_env()`.
- **Funded wallet with delegated signing granted** — the instrument's wallet must hold testnet USDC
  ([faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com/)) and have delegated signing enabled (done in
  Tutorial 00). Without it, the 402 payment step fails.
- **Python 3.10+** and AWS credentials configured (`aws sts get-caller-identity`).
- **Python deps:**
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- **AgentCore CLI (optional)** — only needed for the inspect step below
  (`agentcore status --type payment`). Install with `npm install -g @aws/agentcore` (Node.js 20+).
  Everything the agents do in this tutorial is pure SDK.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1 — Confirm Tutorial 00 populated the shared `.env`

The agents load their configuration from the shared `.env` one directory up. Confirm the keys they
read are present:

```bash
grep -E 'PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN|INSTRUMENT_ID|USER_ID|NETWORK' ../.env
```

If any of `PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN`, `INSTRUMENT_ID`, or `USER_ID` is missing, re-run Tutorial 00
([`../00-setup-agentcore-payments/`](../00-setup-agentcore-payments/)) to write the resource IDs
before continuing. (`NETWORK` is optional.)

### Step 2 — Run the Strands agent

```bash
python strands_payment_agent.py
```

The script loads the manager ARN and instrument from `.env`, creates a per-run spending session
in-code with the SDK (`manager.create_payment_session(...)`, budget set by the `SESSION_BUDGET`
constant near the top of the script), wires up `AgentCorePaymentsPlugin`, and asks the agent to fetch
the paid weather endpoint — the plugin settles each HTTP 402 automatically within the session budget.
(This is the flow in the **Strands Payment Flow** diagram under [Architecture](#architecture) above.)

### Step 3 — Run the LangGraph agent

```bash
python langgraph_payment_agent.py
```

Same `.env` and instrument; it creates its own in-code session the same way. The script builds the
`wrap_with_auto_402()` wrapper around
a `requests`-based `http_request` tool and runs a streaming ReAct agent against the x402 endpoint
`/api/market-news`. On each 402 it calls
`manager.generate_payment_header()` to sign the proof and retries.
(This is the flow in the **LangGraph Payment Flow** diagram under [Architecture](#architecture) above.)

## Try different budgets (payment limits)

Budget enforcement lives on the session, which each agent creates in-code with the SDK. Change the
budget by editing the `SESSION_BUDGET` constant near the top of the script, then re-run the agent.
For example, set a tiny budget smaller than the API cost:

```python
# strands_payment_agent.py / langgraph_payment_agent.py — near the top
SESSION_BUDGET = {"maxSpendAmount": {"value": "0.0001", "currency": "USD"}}
```

Re-run `python strands_payment_agent.py` — the payment is rejected because the $0.0001 budget is
smaller than the API cost. Enforcement is structural (service-level), not agent logic.

To compare two budgets in one run, create a second session in-code with a tiny budget:

```python
tiny = manager.create_payment_session(
    user_id=USER_ID,
    limits={"maxSpendAmount": {"value": "0.0001", "currency": "USD"}},
    expiry_time_in_minutes=60,
)
```

Pass `tiny["paymentSessionId"]` to the plugin (or the wrapper) instead of the $1.00 session and
re-run. Omit `limits` entirely from `create_payment_session` for an uncapped session (spend tracked
but not capped). Read a session's remaining budget in-code with the SDK:

```python
sess = manager.get_payment_session(user_id=USER_ID, payment_session_id=SESSION_ID)
print(sess["availableLimits"]["availableSpendAmount"])
```

This is the workshop's division of labor: infrastructure is provisioned once with the agentcore CLI,
each per-user session is created in-code with the SDK, and the agent's `AgentCorePaymentsPlugin` /
`generate_payment_header()` handles the pay-and-retry at request time.

## What the agents do

Each script's default run does the **happy path** — one paid call under a $1.00 session. Strands calls
the weather endpoint; LangGraph calls `/api/market-news`. The remaining scenarios below are exercised
by changing `SESSION_BUDGET` (or creating a second session) and re-running, as described in
[Try different budgets](#try-different-budgets-payment-limits) above:

| Scenario | How to run it | What it shows |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Happy path | Default run ($1.00 session) | The 402 → sign → retry → 200 flow, fully automatic |
| Budget session | Set `SESSION_BUDGET` to `$0.50`, re-run | Remaining spend after a paid call (`get_payment_session`) |
| Budget exceeded | Set `SESSION_BUDGET` to `$0.0001` (below API cost), re-run | ProcessPayment rejects the payment at the infra level |
| Built-in tools (Strands) | Default run — agent answers "how much budget is left?" | Plugin tools `get_payment_session` / `get_payment_instrument` / `list_payment_instruments` |
| Uncapped session | Create a session with no `limits` | Spend tracked but not capped — for trusted agents only |

Budget enforcement is cumulative and server-side: the service sums all `ProcessPayment` calls in a
session and rejects the next payment once `maxSpendAmount` would be exceeded, or once the session
expires. The agent role cannot raise its own budget.

## Inspect / verify

```bash
# Live view of managers, connectors, and payment status (requires the AgentCore CLI).
# `status --type payment` reads a scaffolded project's config — run it from the Tutorial 00 project dir:
cd ../00-setup-agentcore-payments/PaymentSetup && agentcore status --type payment

# Confirm the keys the scripts read are present
grep -E 'PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN|PAYMENT_CONNECTOR_ID|INSTRUMENT_ID|USER_ID|NETWORK' ../.env
```

The scripts read a specific session's remaining spend in-code with the SDK
(`manager.get_payment_session(...)`). Do the same from a quick Python one-liner:

```python
from bedrock_agentcore.payments import PaymentManager

manager = PaymentManager(payment_manager_arn=PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN, region_name=REGION)
sess = manager.get_payment_session(user_id=USER_ID, payment_session_id=SESSION_ID)
print(sess["availableLimits"]["availableSpendAmount"])   # remaining spend
```

Check the funded wallet's balance with the SDK (`chain` and `token` are required; map `NETWORK` to the
chain):

```python
from bedrock_agentcore.payments import PaymentManager

manager = PaymentManager(payment_manager_arn=PAYMENT_MANAGER_ARN, region_name=REGION)
chain = "BASE_SEPOLIA" if NETWORK == "ETHEREUM" else "SOLANA_DEVNET"
bal = manager.get_payment_instrument_balance(
    payment_connector_id=PAYMENT_CONNECTOR_ID,
    payment_instrument_id=INSTRUMENT_ID,
    chain=chain,
    token="USDC",
    user_id=USER_ID,
)
print(bal["tokenBalance"]["amount"] / 1_000_000, "USDC")   # micro-USDC → USDC
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `load_tutorial_env()` raises `FileNotFoundError`, or `PaymentManager` fails on a `None` ARN | Tutorial 00 didn't finish — `../.env` is missing or has no resource IDs | Re-run Tutorial 00 to write the resource IDs to `../.env` |
| Agent gets 402 but payment fails | Delegated signing not granted for the wallet | Coinbase CDP: enable Delegated Signing in CDP Portal → Wallets → Embedded Wallet → Policies. Stripe/Privy: open the Privy reference frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, log in as `LINKED_EMAIL`, choose **Connect agent** |
| Budget exceeded immediately | Session budget below API cost, or wallet has insufficient USDC | Expected for the $0.0001 demo; otherwise fund the wallet at [faucet.circle.com](https://faucet.circle.com/) |
| `invalid_exact_evm_transaction_failed` / settlement failure | Transient on-chain failure (e.g. back-to-back payments) | Retry — funds are not debited on a failed attempt |
| `agentcore: command not found` | CLI not installed (only needed for the inspect step) | `npm install -g @aws/agentcore` |

## Clean Up

This tutorial provisions nothing durable — payment **sessions expire automatically** at
`expiryTimeInMinutes`, so there is nothing to tear down here. The shared manager/connector/instrument
and any deployed runtimes are cleaned up in their owning tutorials. To remove the shared stack from
Tutorial 00 (delete the per-user instrument with the SDK first — see Tutorial 00's Clean Up):

```bash
cd ../00-setup-agentcore-payments/PaymentSetup
agentcore remove payment-connector --manager MyPaymentManager --name MyCoinbaseConnector -y
agentcore remove payment-manager --name MyPaymentManager -y
agentcore deploy -y        # applies the removal in AWS
agentcore remove all -y    # removes the scaffolded runtime project
```

## Next steps

- **[Tutorial 02](../02-deploy-to-agentcore-runtime/)** — deploy this agent to AgentCore Runtime with
  role separation using the AgentCore CLI.
- **[Tutorial 03](../03-user-onboarding-wallet-funding/)** — per-user wallet onboarding, funding,
  delegation, and balance checks.
- **[Tutorial 04](../04-agent-with-coinbase-bazaar-via-gateway/)** — discover and call paid MCP tools
  on Coinbase Bazaar through an AgentCore Gateway.
